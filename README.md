# Leveraging Text Classification to Identify Risk Factors in Adolescent Emotional Disorders and Self-Harm

This project investigates the use of advanced text classification methods to identify risk factors associated with adolescent emotional disorders and self-harm. The work leverages multi-modal data integration and temporal psychological dynamics to improve prediction accuracy and clinical insight.

## üß† Project Overview

Adolescent emotional disorders and self-harm represent significant public health concerns due to their impact on long-term well-being. Traditional assessment tools‚Äîlike surveys and interviews‚Äîare often constrained by issues such as data sparsity, limited scope, and the complexity of emotional trajectories.

This project proposes an innovative solution that utilizes:

- **Latent Psychodynamics Transformer (LPT)**: A novel deep learning architecture for multi-modal fusion and temporal modeling.
- **Structured temporal latent information**: To capture evolving emotional states.
- **Advanced machine learning**: For text classification using multi-source inputs such as behavioral data and clinical assessments.

## üöÄ Key Contributions

- Introduced a new model, the **Latent Psychodynamics Transformer (LPT)**, which outperforms traditional methods in handling variable emotional signals and multi-modal fusion.
- Demonstrated the model‚Äôs capability in both **temporal prediction** and **multi-modal reasoning** across real-world adolescent datasets.
- Validated performance using experimental and real-world benchmarks, showing significant improvement in identifying at-risk individuals.
